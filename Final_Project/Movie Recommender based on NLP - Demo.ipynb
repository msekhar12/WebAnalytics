    "# Movie Recommender based on NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook I will demonstrate a simple Movie Recommender Engine based on NLP (Natural Language Processing) method. For the purpose of the project I have written a Python based web crawler to download Movie plot and images (movie poster) from Wikipedia. The details of the web crwaler and the complete implementation of the project can be found at:https://goo.gl/wsvBcp\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the recommender system or create or enhance your own text based recommender, you have to download the following files:\n",
    "\n",
    "**processed_data.csv**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **processed_data.csv** has the following column names:\n",
    "     * Movie_ID, which uniquely identifies a Movie\n",
    "     * Plot, which has all the movie plot (text) downloaded from Wikipedia\n",
    "\n",
    "**images**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **images** directory will have the images of Movie posters (which are obtained from Wikipedia). \n",
    "\n",
    "**recommender_setup.py**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **recommender_setup.py** program has all the necessary code to run the recommender.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** I scraped movie release posters to render the recommendations in a more aesthetic fashion. However, I could not get all the movie posters, since some of them are not available, and some of them were not easily downloadable by the crawler since the webpage's HTML IDs are not consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "The package **recommender_setup.py** will setup everything to run the recommender. Once you import this package you can use the following function to get the movie recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Make_Selection(movie_name = \"a\")**\n",
    "\n",
    "      This function will accept a search string as input and display the movies which have the matching text. It prompts you to enter the movie ID, based on which you would like to get the recommendations. For example, to get the recommendations given that the user has liked the movie \"Matrix\", you can call the function Make_Selection(movie_name = \"Matrix\"). The function will prompt you to enter the movie ID (since there could be more than one movie with the name \"Matrix\"). Based on the movie ID selected by the user the recommendations are generated.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "### Environment      \n",
    "\n",
    "You need the following software/packages to to run this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python 3\n",
    "* Pandas\n",
    "* Numpy\n",
    "* Sklearn\n",
    "\n",
    "To develop/enhance the project, you need the following additional packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* BeautifulSoup\n",
