Chinese Coffee is a one-act play, written by Ira Lewis.[1]Harry Levine (Pacino) is a struggling writer (barely) ekeing out a living as a doorman—that is, until he is fired. Desperate for money, he pays a visit to his friend Jake Manheim (Orbach), an arts photographer, to collect an old debt. After Jake says he does not have the money, the two engage in an all-night conversation about their respective art, past and present loves, and the directions their lives are heading. The play and film are set in Greenwich Village circa 1982.
