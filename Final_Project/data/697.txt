Carolina is a 2003 romantic comedy film directed by Marleen Gorris, starring Julia Stiles, Shirley MacLaine, Alessandro Nivola, Mika Boorem, Randy Quaid, and Jennifer Coolidge.[1] Lisa Sheridan has a cameo role in the film, and Barbara Eden has the uncredited part of Daphne.[2] It is set in Los Angeles, California. Shot in 2003, the film failed to find a distributor and was released direct-to-video in 2005. Miramax Films was the domestic distributor, but failed to release it in theaters. When Harvey Weinstein screened the film he told the producers, "You have a hit movie on your hands. We're going to blast this on MTV all over Super Bowl Weekend."[citation needed] This was in December 2001. The producers never heard about it again until 2005 when it was suddenly released Direct-to-DVD. The film began principal photography in July 2001. Kathy Bates was originally slated to play the role of "Grandma Millicent Mirabeau", but dropped out after make-up/hair tests due to the shut down of the original production shoot date. Shirley MacLaine eventually stepped in to play the role of "Grandma Millicent Mirabeau".
