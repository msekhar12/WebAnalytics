Koch is a 2012 documentary film directed by Neil Barsky about former New York City Mayor Ed Koch. Koch premiered at the Hamptons International Film Festival on October 8, 2012[2] and is distributed by Zeitgeist Films.[3] It opened theatrically in the United States on February 1, 2013 (coincidentally, the day of Koch's death).[4][5]First-time filmmaker and former Wall Street Journal reporter Neil Barsky’s 2012 documentary film Koch explores the origins, career, and legacy of Edward Irving “Ed” Koch, who served as Mayor of New York City for three consecutive terms from 1978 to 1989. With candid interviews and rare archival footage, the film offers a close look at a man known for being intensely private in spite of his dynamic public persona, and chronicles the tumultuous events which marked his time in office – a fiercely competitive 1977 election, the 1980 transit strike, the burgeoning AIDS epidemic, landmark housing renewal initiatives, and an irreparable municipal corruption scandal. Poignant and often humorous, Koch is a portrait not only of one of New York’s most iconic political figures, but of New York City itself at a time of radical upheaval and transformation.
