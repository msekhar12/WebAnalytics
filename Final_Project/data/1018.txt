Mojados: Through the Night is a 2004 documentary film directed by Tommy Davis. The film documents the journey of four men[1] as they trek 120 miles across the Texas desert.   Filmed over the course of ten days the film follows four men into the world of illegal immigration. Alongside Bear, Tiger, Handsome, and Old Man, director Davis takes a 120-mile cross-desert journey[2] that has been traveled innumerable times by nameless immigrants like these four migrants from Michoacán, Mexico. Davis tells the stories of these migrants as their dehydrated days evading the U.S. Border Patrol turn into sub-zero nights filled with barbed wire, storms and ever-present confrontation with death.[3]
