Panic is a 2000 American crime film directed by Henry Bromell and starring William H. Macy, Neve Campbell, Tracey Ullman, John Ritter and Donald Sutherland.Alex (Macy), a sad-eyed mournful man, goes into psychotherapy disclosing that he is a hit man. He also tells the doctor (Ritter) after a few sessions that he is attracted to a young woman he has met in the waiting room. She is Sarah (Campbell), 23, quick, edgy, and perhaps attracted to him as well. But he is married, the dutiful father of a young precocious boy, so Sarah brushes him off. In flashbacks we see him get his start as a killer, at his father's prompting since it is the family business. Dad gives Alex his next assignment: to kill the therapist. Alex keeps returning to Sarah, calling her, stopping by her apartment, as he decides what to do about the hit, his father, his marriage and his malaise.
