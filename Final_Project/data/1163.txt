Dirty Love is a 2005 American romantic comedy film written by and starring Jenny McCarthy and directed by John Mallory Asher. At the time of filming, McCarthy and Asher were married; they divorced the month the film was released.[2] Playing heavily off McCarthy's reputation for toilet humor, the film was critically panned and was a box office bomb; it also received the Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Picture.

Struggling photographer Rebecca Sommers finds her model boyfriend Richard in bed with another woman. He also destroys all of her camera equipment. Her life falls apart, and she alternates between desire for revenge upon him, sexual promiscuity and abandonment of all hope of love. Her best friends, Michelle and Carrie, try to set her up on dates. These include one with a freakish magician and another with a man who gives her ecstasy and has a fetish for fish. She attempts to make Richard jealous by taking a director, who is reminiscent of Woody Allen, to a runway show, but he ends up vomiting on her breasts in front of everyone.Ultimately, Rebecca realizes she should focus her energy on being with someone who truly loves her, and that turns out to be John, her nerdy but caring best male friend who has been supportive of her through the entire ordeal.
