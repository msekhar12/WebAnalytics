TriStar PicturesFour-year-old Colton Burpo (Connor Corum) is the son of Todd Burpo (Greg Kinnear), pastor of Crossroads Wesleyan Church in Imperial, Nebraska. Colton says he experienced Heaven during emergency surgery. He describes to his incredulous family about having looked down to see the doctor operating, his mother calling people to pray in the waiting room, and his father in another room yelling at God not to let him die. He also speaks of meeting his great-grandfather, who died long before he was born, his unborn sister that died in a miscarriage whom no one had told him about, and meeting Jesus, describing his physical appearance.As Colton continues to speak about his experiences in Heaven, Todd is faced with the dilemma of determining if his son's experience was genuine or a hallucination based on a near-death experience. His wariness about discussing the situation erodes the confidence of the board members of his church, and he is contacted by several members of the media. When Todd is called by a radio station for an impromptu interview on the air, he invites them to attend his sermon the following Sunday. At church, he preaches about his son's experiences and reveals his support for him.Following the events at the church, Todd is doing research on the Internet and finds a story about a Lithuanian girl who had a similar experience. She painted a portrait of Jesus, and Colton stated that her portrait was completely identical to how Jesus looked when he visited Heaven, as he replied "That's Him." Todd tries to speak to Colton further about the picture but he is interrupted by his wife revealing to him that she is pregnant with another child. The film concludes with photos of Colton and his family in the present day.
