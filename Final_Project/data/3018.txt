The film is punctuated with flashbacks of scenes of Barthes' young childhood and his mother's suicide.Sub-plots include the struggles of Dr. Parker (Lucy Liu) within her role as the school counselor and the painful torment of Principal Dearden (Marcia Gay Harden), who faces her dismissal as head of this deeply flawed school.
