Yellow is a 2006 film starring Roselyn Sanchez. The film follows the life of Amarillys Campos (Sanchez), a classically trained Puerto Rican dancer who moves to New York City after her father's suicide to pursue her dreams of becoming a famous dancer, but ends up becoming a stripper at a seedy nightclub to make ends meet. Upon her arrival to New York, she moves into a ratty apartment and becomes close with her neighbor, Miles, a former professor of poetry at New York University who currently works at a supermarket due to the fact that he has become mentally unstable. While working as a stripper, she meets a lonely doctor Christian Kyle (Sweeney) who feels the need to protect her, and the two begin a relationship. When the doctor proposes that they move to Australia, Amarillys must decide between her lifelong desire to be a famous dancer, mending a relationship with her family back in Puerto Rico, and taking a chance with her new love.
