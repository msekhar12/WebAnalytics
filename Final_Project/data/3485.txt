After the interview, he starts his concert with a rendition of Lynn Minmei's "We Will Win".Following the concert as Lancer sits alone at night and only thinks to himself, he is surprised by his returning family.

Lancer denies an invitation from Scott and Rand to join them on the fleet's new mission to find Admiral Hunter and the SDF-3, giving his own valid reason as they all head off for some sleep. Lancer remains awake and leaves his family behind. He drives through the country while back at his small cabin, Sera prepares breakfast for her returning love. As he returns, Lancer and Sera reaffirm their devotion and Sera reveals to him that she is expecting their first child soon.
