At first, Nixon is annoyed by what he sees as a PR stunt, but over the course of the meeting finds that they have much in common: they both came from humble beginnings and worked hard for their success, and they both feel unappreciated by an American culture they no longer understand. They part on good terms, and pose together for an iconic photograph.On February 16, 1971, Nixon begins recording every meeting and phone call in the Oval Office.
