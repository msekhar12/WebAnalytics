Hanging Up is a 2000 American comedy-drama film about a trio of sisters who bond over the approaching death of their curmudgeonly father to whom none of them were particularly close. The film stars Diane Keaton (who also directed), Meg Ryan, and Lisa Kudrow as the three sisters, and Walter Matthau (in his final film appearance) as the father. The film is based on 1995 book of the same name by Delia Ephron.Georgia Mozell, Eve Marks and Maddy Mozell are adult sisters. Georgia (Keaton) is the editor of her own wildly successful self-titled women’s magazine. She strives for publicity at any cost. Party planner Eve (Ryan) is the mother hen of the group, not only of her own family, but also of her siblings and father as their mother, Pat (Leachman), not only emotionally left their father when they divorced, but her daughters as well. And Maddy (Kudrow) is a vacuous soap opera actress who has always struggled for her own identity. Despite being as busy with her own life as the others, Eve is the only one of the three who deals with the long term hospitalization of their cantankerous seventy-nine-year-old father, Lou Mozell, when he enters the early stages of dementia, and the associated outcomes of that hospitalization. Eve’s caring for Lou is despite an especially hurtful incident with him seven years earlier (when he told her she was a mistake). As the emotional aspect of looking after Lou becomes more and more stressful, Eve has to figure out how to maintain her own sanity, while dealing with her sisters, who believe they too are part of their father’s care while they don’t lift a finger to help.
