Lamb Mannerhelm (Julianne Hough) goes to speak at her family's church in Montana one year after surviving a plane crash, which has left her with severe burns all over her body. While everyone is expecting her to make some big announcement, she instead publicly denounces her belief in God, causing a major uproar in the church. Lamb later explains some of the strict rules she has to live by in her conservative town, like listening only to Christian music, and not being allowed to wear pants. Feeling both angry and inexperienced in life, Lamb heads to Las Vegas to indulge in the sinful pleasures that are objected in her community as she sees surviving the plane crash as a second chance at life and time for her to now live life on her own terms. Once there, she goes to a random bar in order to have her first drink, where she meets a bartender named William (Russell Brand), and a singer named Loray (Octavia Spencer).
