    "### Movie recommendations based on text from Wikipedia\n",
    "_July 12, 2017_\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Group 1 Members:\n",
    "* Mauricio Alarcon\n",

    "* Srinivasa Illapani\n",
    "* Param Singh\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "Movies recommendation is one of the classic application of recommendation systems, and there are several ways to achieve this. In this project, our goal is to apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to the movie plot obtained from Wikipedia and determine relevant movies for a given movie. We scraped text related to 4037 movies from Wikipedia. These movies are American movies released since the year 2000. The key deliverables of this project are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Text corpus of 4037 movies\n",
    "* Movie posters of 3749 movies\n",
    "* Movie recommender based on movie's plot\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Technologies used:\n",
    "We used the following software/packages to develop the core logic of this project:\n",
    "* Python 3\n",
    "* Pandas\n",
    "* Numpy\n",
    "* Sklearn\n",
    "* BeautifulSoup\n",
    "* urllib\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** We scraped movie release posters to render the recommendations in a more aesthetic fashion. However, we could not get all the movie posters, since some of them are not available, and some of them were not easily downloadable by our crawler since the webpage's HTML IDs are not consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is divided into 4 logical phases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Phase-1: Build a web crawler to download the movies text and release posters\n",
    "2. Phase-2: Cleanse the text data to build the recommender system\n",
    "3. Phase-3: Build the recommender system using the text data\n",
    "4. Phase-4: Get the recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent sections will have a detailed explanation of these phases."

    "# I. Phase-1: Build a Web Crawler\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal of **Phase-1** is to build a web crawler and scrape the text related to American movies, which were released between 2000 and 2016 years. Along with the text, we will also crawl the Movies posters. The major deliverables of this phase are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Text (or plot) of American movies, which were released between the years 2000 and 2016\n",
    "2. Movies release posters\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: All the data will be obtained from Wikipedia.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## I.I Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia maintains list of movies, released in each year. The list of American movies released in each year are present at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_American_films_of_XXXX, where XXXX is the year. For each year between 2000 and 2016 (XXXX = 2000 to 2016), we have to recurrsively visit each year's URL to obtain the movies URLs, along with movie details such as cast, director, genre etc. Once the URLs related to all the movies are obtained, the web crawler will visit the movie URLs to scrape the plot of the movie. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following flowchart will provide an overview of the web crawling process:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"crawler_logic.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    " **Figure-1: Web crawling process**\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole web crawling process is divided into 2 steps. In Step-1, we will visit Wikipedia to obtain a list of all the URLs related to the American movies which were released between the years 2000-2016. In Step-2, we will visit each of the URLs obtained in Step-1, to download movie text and release poster. There must be some delay of 2 to 3 seconds between successive requests to Wikipedia website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of Step-1 will be a comma separated file (Movie_Details.csv), with the following details: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Movie** - Movie Name\n",
    "\n",
    "**URL** - Wikipedia web page for the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "**Year** - Year of release\n",
    "\n",
    "**Director** - Director of the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cast** - Cast of the movie\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genre** - Movie's genre\n",
    "\n",
    "**Movie_ID** - Unique key to distinguish each movie\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of Step-2 will be a set of text files, each file named using the Movie_ID, and a set of image files, each of the image files will also be named using the Movie_ID. Naming the files using the Movie_ID will help us to refer movie's text and image files uniquely."

Returns 0, if sucessfully saved. Returns -1, when the change directory command fails (while changing to _data_ sub-directory), and -2 when the change to parent directory from _data_ fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Get_And_Save_Image(bs,image_file_name)** It will get the movies poster (image file) and saves the image in the _images_ directory. It will take beautiful soup object as input and extracts the image URL. The image URL will be downloaded and saved to _images_ directory with the file name as the value present in *image_file_name*. Returns 0, if successfully downloaded and saved. Returns -1 if image is not found, and -2 if the an error occurs when saving the image.\n",

    "## IV. Phase-4: Getting recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us build the required functions to make movie recommendations, given that the user has liked a movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IV.I Functions\n",
    "* **Get_Recommendations(Movie_ID,cos_sim_df)** This function will accept *Movie_ID*, and *cos_sim_df* as inputs. The *Movie_ID* is a number unique to a movie, and *cos_sim_df* is a pandas data frame containing the cosine similarity scores between all pairs of movies. This function will get top 6 Movies (based on the cosine similarity score between the input Movie_ID and other movies. Higher cosine similarity measure, better the match). The result is returned in the form of a dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Get_Available_Images()** This function will not accept any input. It returns the list of all movie IDs, for which we have an available image.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Display_Recommendations(Recommended_Movies_Dict,Movie_Map,Source_Movie_ID)** This function will accept 3 inputs. The *Recommended_Movies_Dict* is the dictionary of recommended movies (output of *Get_Recommendations(Movie_ID,cos_sim_df)* function). The *Movie_Map* is a data frame with the columns: *\"Movie\" (Movie name),\"Movie_ID\" (Unique ID),\"URL\" (Movie URL)*. This data frame is obtained by joining the *Movie_Details.csv* and *processed_data.csv* files data (using movie ID). This joining is needed, since it will help to map the movies which are successfully downloaded (4037 movies) and all the available movie names (4045 movies). The *Source_Movie_ID* is the movie ID, which is assumed to be liked by the user. The function does NOT return any value. It just renders the recommended movies along with the cosine similarity scores. The user can click on the movie to read visit the wikipedia site or hover on the image to get the text, which was used for building cosine similarity matrix.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project we were able to implement the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Built a web crawler to scrape American movies text and release posters from Wikipedia. The web crawler ran for approximately 7 hours (with a mandatory delay of 3 seconds between each hit) to download the text and images of the movies released after since 2000.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using regular expressions, we cleaned the text, and using sklearn packages, we calculated TF-IDF scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Between each pair of movies, we obtained the cosine similarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* For a given movie _m_, we identified the top 5 relevant movies based on the cosine similarity measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The approach looks promising, since in most of the test cases, the system has found at least 3 relevant movies, out of 5 movies recommended. If this system is combined with other external resources, such as movie ratings (matrix factorization methods like ALS - Alternating Least Squares can be used to predict the ratings a user could give to the movies), then the recommendations quality can improve further. \n"
